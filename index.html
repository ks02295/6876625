The mysteries of dark matter and dark energy will be explored throughout this article where these invisible forces make up
almost all of the universe. Dark matter was first theorized in the 1930s by Fritz Zwicky and then confirmed by Vera Rubin
in the 1970s by observing the Andromeda Galaxy’s stars. Dark energy was discovered through observing the explosion of Type 1a 
Supernova where it led to the idea that it helped with accelerating the expansion of the universe. 
You can detect dark matter through annihilation, scattering/direct direction and production experiments using equipment like 
the Fermi Telescope and the Large Hadron Collider. Even though detecting dark matter is near impossible, you can observe far 
distant galaxies’ red shift where these galaxies are moving away from Earth at great velocities by using Hubble’s equation and 
constant: v = H x d. Observing these forces is challenging to prove, making them still unknown in today’s world.

<p class"ex1"> 
<pre>
In the last 100 years, we have explored the many wonders of our universe – from the precise orbit of the planets
in our solar system to the furthest galaxy away from us. However, all the matter we can see and have researched
on only makes up 5% <a href="https://www.amacad.org/news/universe-stranger-we-thought#:~:text=So%2C%20the%20stars%20and%20galaxies,Is%20Stranger%20Than%20We%20Thought">(Meserve, 2014)</a> of how much we truly have explored it. One of the biggest mysteries that scientists
are struggling to solve is the existence of dark matter and dark energy where dark matter involves gravity to form 
galaxies/galaxy clusters by sticking gas, dust and stars together <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/dark-matter/en/">(NASA Space Place, 2024)</a> while dark energy is involved in
accelerating the expansion of the universe <a href="https://www.space.com/dark-energy-what-is-it">(Lea, 2022)</a>. This will be further discussed throughout where we see how these two 
ideas have been discovered, how we can detect dark matter and energy and if there’s technology to prove they exist.

Dark matter was first thought of in the early 1930s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsdark-matter#:~:text=The%20term%20dark%20matter%20was,galaxies%20in%20the%20Coma%20Cluster.">(Bautista, no date)</a> by a Swiss American astronomer called Fritz Zwicky,
who realised that the stars making up the Coma Cluster of galaxies only made up 1% of the mass needed to keep the galaxies 
from escaping the gravitational pull <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/dark-matter">(Riess, 2024)</a>. Decades later during the 1970s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/dark-matter">(Riess, 2024)</a>, an astronomer named
Vera Rubin confirmed that dark matter did exist by looking at the velocities of the inner and outer stars of the 
Andromeda Galaxy. However, they realised that the rotation was flat – the velocities of the stars at the centre and at 
the outer ends of the galaxy were the same. It was surprising because the outer stars were moving so fast that it should
have flown away. This then concluded that there was some kind of matter which we can’t see that was holding the galaxy 
together – this was dark matter <a href="https://www.space.com/vera-rubin.html">(Childers, 2019)</a>.

Dark energy accelerates the expansion of the universe and works against gravity to tear stars and galaxies apart <a href="https://www.space.com/dark-energy-what-is-it">(Lea, 2022)</a>.
It was discovered when two independent astronomers studied the explosion of white dwarfs (called type 1a supernova) where 
they were able to see the emitted light coming from the blast but the further they were away from them, the dimmer the light 
coming from the blasts will be. The distance was then measured and found out that the supernovas with greater redshifts had 
dimmer light then it should be where the expansion of the universe was not speeding up. Therefore, they concluded that it was 
some sort of dark energy that was accelerating the expansion of the universe <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/type-ia-supernova/">(NASA Science, 2023)</a>.

Dark matter can’t emit, absorb or reflect light, which is why it is so difficult for scientists to find dark matter
in our universe. However, because dark matter interacts with gravity, we can look at its indirect effects on gravity 
and how it affects other objects with mass and light <a href="https://www.space.com/if-dark-matter-invisible-how-do-we-know-it-exists">(Lea, 2023)</a>. One possible method of detecting dark matter is
through annihilation. Standard model particles are formed when dark matter particles annihilate their anti-particles,
and a detector called The Fermi Telescope is used to find any gamma ray anomaly signals. Another method is called 
scattering/direct direction where dark matter scatters off Standard Model Particles, producing a signal that is detected
by highly advanced equipment. Scientists have looked at dark matter particles scattering off xenon atoms, which produces 
light when struck by other particles. The final method is through production experiments. At high energies, two Standard Model 
particles collide with each other, producing an explosion which can produce some dark matter particles along with many Standard
Model particles. The Large Hadron Collider is currently conducting production experiments <a href="https://particleastro.brown.edu/dark-matter/#:~:text=Scattering%20(Direct%20Detection),be%20detected%20with%20modern%20instruments.">(Brown Particle Astrophysics Group, no date)</a>.

There's no technology created so far to allow scientists to see and find dark energy in our universe, 
however, scientists can observe distant galaxies to prove that our universe is rapidly accelerating because of the
force given from dark energy that seems to drive it. An example is redshift. It means the change in the stretching of 
light waves from distant galaxies <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.023537">(Heinesen, 2021)</a>;; astronomers use redshift to figure out how far
an object is from Earth which is what Edward Hubble did in 1929 where nearly all the galaxies he was observing was moving 
away rapidly – the further the galaxy was, the faster it was moving away from Earth <a href="https://www.space.com/25732-redshift-blueshift.html">(Howell and Dobrijevic, 2023)</a>. The 
velocity of a galaxy can be found by using the equation v = H x d where v = radial outward velocity, d = the distance between 
the galaxy and Earth, and H = contant of proportionality (Hubble’s constant) <a href="https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/redshift.html">(The StarChild Team, NASA, no date)</a> which 
is approimately 2.3 x 10^-18 s^-1 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zphppv4/revision/3#:~:text=Hubble%27s%20constant%20is%20approximately%20%20%282.3imes%2010%5E%20%7B-18%7Ds%5E,is%20from%20Earth%2C%20the%20faster%20it%20is%20moving.">(BBC Bitesize, 2024)</a>. The values in the table below shows how the
velocity and the distance in metres are directly proportional to each other; as the distance increases, so does the velocity.

However, redshift can be affected by local features of the universe such as the movement of galaxies and other areas
in space where space can stretch differently - so it doesn’t directly measure the universe's expansion rate <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.023537">(Heinesen, 2021)</a>.

    <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3> 

<p class"ex1">
<pre>
To conclude, dark matter and energy remains the most challenging topic to uncover about in our universe. For what we
already know, dark matter interacts with gravity to create galaxies whereas dark energy plays an important role in 
accelerating the expansion of the universe but proving that these forces exist still questions scientists to this day. 
Although we can’t see them, advanced equipment such as the Fermi Telescope and the Large Hadron Collider to study how 
these forces act and what properties they are made up of. With redshift being strong evidence that the universe is accelerating
at a fast rate, it is still indirect proof that dark energy exists. However, this evidence can help develop other new technology
and ideas in the future which can one day lead to finally being able to see dark matter and energy and ultimately, discover more 
than 5% of our universe.
